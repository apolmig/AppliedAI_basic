This notebook and the software described herein is intended to give those students some sample code to work with and a bit of a head start on concepts and architecture. (In particular, this material was inspired by conversations I had with [Utsav Chadha](https://itp.nyu.edu/thesis2018/#/student/utsav-chadha) and [Nouf Aljowaysir](https://itp.nyu.edu/thesis2018/#/student/nouf-aljowaysir) during the Spring 2018 semester at ITP.)\n","\n","In the notebook, I'll show how the chatbot works and build an example chatbot using the [Cornell Movie Dialog Corpus](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/~cristian/Cornell_Movie-Dialogs_Corpus.html). Even if you don't know anything about programming or natural language processing or machine learning or whatever, you can step through the cells in this notebook and play around with the chatbot itself at the very end.\n","\n","> **TLDR version**: To run the chatbot, just keep hitting shift+enter until you reach the end. (A bunch of stuff needs to download and build, so it'll take a few minutes. Sorry.) If you're using Google Colab, there will be a little chat widget right in the notebook. If you're in Jupyter Notebook, there will be a link you can click on to open the chat in a new browser window.\n","\n","> **Content warning**: The Cornell Movie Dialog Corpus has dialog from many movies, including some with potentially objectionable content. When playing around with this code, you might see text from the dialog of these films, including (in some cases) violent language and slurs directed at marginalized groups. If you make a chatbot with this code and this corpus and make it available to a wide audience, consider including a content warning similar to this one and/or filtering the corpus and output of the bot to exclude words and sentiments like this.\n","\n","## Making a chatbot the easy way\n","\n","There are [lots](https://www.rivescript.com/) [of](https://rasa.com/) [ways](https://botpress.io/) to author chatbots, but many of them are oriented toward particular use cases (i.e., automating customer service), and require extensive hand-authoring of content or hand-labelling of data. Others (i.e., those that use seq2seq) require you to train a neural network from scratch, which is fine if you're into that kind of thing, but can sometimes feel like a rotten way to spend your money and your afternoon (or weekend, or month, or whatever).\n","\n","The chatbot in this notebook won't pass a Turing test or push percentage points on any machine learning accuracy evaluations, but it's (a) easy to understand (b) works with any corpus (c) doesn't require training a new model and (d) uncannily faithful to whatever source material you give it while still being amusingly bizarre. From a technical perspective, you can think of it as a sort of low-rent version of [Talk to Books](https://books.google.com/talktobooks/), which (as I understand it) works along similar principles.\n","\n","So how does this chatbot work? To answer that question we have to think about how *conversations* work.\n","\n","### Defining the conversation\n","\n","For the purposes of this chatbot, let's make a very simple \"toy\" definition of conversation. We'll say that a conversation consists of *two people taking turns at making utterances.* We'll call any individual utterance a *turn*. When one participant finishes their turn, the next participant can take their own turn; we'll call this second turn a *response* to the first. The conversation continues this way, with each turn being a response to the previous turn, until it comes to an end (usually due to a mutual agreement reached by the participants, which in the case of our chatbot, means whenever the human gets sick of chatting and closes the browser tab).\n","\n","To illustrate, here's a simple conversation I just invented between two participants, A and B. The first column numbers the turns, the second column labels the participant, and the third column gives the text of the turn:\n","\n","| # | P | Text |\n","|-|-|:-|\n","| 1 | A | Hello. |\n","| 2 | B | Good to see you! |\n","| 3 | A | I'm reading a tutorial on semantic similarity and chatbots. It's quite interesting. |\n","| 4 | B | Thanks for letting me know. |\n","| 5 | A | Any time. Well, I gotta go. |\n","| 6 | B | Talk to you soon! |\n","| 7 | A | Goodbye. |\n","\n","This fascinating conversation has seven turns. Turn 2 is the response to turn 1, turn 3 is the response to turn 2, etc.\n","\n","> *Note:* I said this was a \"toy\" definition for a reason—conversations are actually *way* more complicated than this. If you're interested in how conversations actually work, check out [conversation analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conversation_analysis), a whole subfield of linguistics devoted to this kind of thing.\n","\n","### Taking a turn\n","\n","At a certain basic level, the job of a chatbot at any moment in a conversation is to produce a conversational turn that seems to plausibly be in response to the turn that preceded it. There are a number of different ways to solve this problem. Our strategy is going to be the following:\n","\n","1. Make a database of conversations and the turns that constitute them;\n","2. Assign a *vector* to each turn that corresponds to its meaning (more on this in a second);\n","3. When asked to respond to a conversational turn from the user, display the *response* to the turn in the database most similar in meaning to the user's turn.\n","\n","For example, take the conversation that I invented earlier. Imagine putting all of these turns into the database and assigning each turn a vector representing its meaning. Our chatbot now has a database of six possible responses (not counting the first turn, since it began the conversation and wasn't in response to any other turn). If the user typed in something like...\n","\n","    > Howdy!\n","    \n","... our chatbot would then search its database for the turn closest in meaning to `Howdy!` Maybe that turn is turn #1 (`Hello.`). The chatbot would then display the turn that happened *in response* to turn #1 (i.e., turn #2, `Good to see you!`). If the user typed in...\n","\n","    > Thank you for the great conversation!\n","    \n","... our chatbot would find the turn in its database closest in meaning, maybe turn #4 (`Thanks for letting me know.`), and then print out its associated response (turn #5, `Any time. Well, I gotta go.`). The final transcript of this imaginary (and admittedly a little contrived) conversation, with the human's turn labelled with `H` and the bot as `B`:\n","\n","    H: Howdy!\n","    B: Hello.\n","    H: Thank you for the great conversation!\n","    B: Any time. Well, I gotta go!\n","    \n","Perfectly plausible!\n","\n","So you can think of this semantic similarity chatbot as a kind of search engine. When you type something into the chat, the chatbot *searches its database for the most appropriate response*.\n","\n","### Word vectors\n","\n","\"This is all well and good,\" you say. \"But how do you make a computer program that knows how similar in meaning two sentences are? How do you even *measure* similarity in meaning?\" Figuring out a way to measure similarity in meaning is one of the classic problems in computational linguistics, and it's still very much an open problem. But there are certain easy-to-use techniques that are \"good enough\" for our purposes. In particular, we're going to use *word vectors*.\n","\n","[I've written a more detailed introduction to word vectors here](https://github.com/aparrish/rwet/blob/master/understanding-word-vectors.ipynb), if you want the whole story. But the short version is this: using machine learning techniques and a lot of data, it's possible to assign each word a sequence of numbers (i.e., a vector) that encodes the word's meaning. (Actually, it's encoding the word's *distribution*, or all of the other words that the word is usually seen alongside. But it turns out that this is a good substitute for representing a word's meaning.) \n","\n","A word vector looks a lot like the Cartesian X, Y coordinates you likely studied in school, except that they usually have many hundreds of dimensions, not just two. (More dimensions means more information about the word's distribution.) For example, here's the vector for the word \"cheese\" using the fifty-dimensional pre-trained vectors from GloVe:\n","\n","    -0.053903 -0.30871 -1.3285 -0.43342 0.31779 1.5224 -0.6965 -0.037086 -0.83784 0.074107 -0.30532 -0.1783 1.2337 0.085473 0.17362 -0.19001 0.36907 0.49454 -0.024311 -1.0535 0.5237 -1.1489 0.95093 1.1538 -0.52286 -0.14931 -0.97614 1.3912 0.79875 -0.72134 1.5411 -0.15928 -0.30472 1.7265 0.13124 -0.054023 -0.74212 1.675 1.9502 -0.53274 1.1359 0.20027 0.02245 -0.39379 1.0609 1.585 0.17889 0.43556 0.68161 0.066202\n","\n","Experts have made [large databases of word vectors available for people to download and use](https://nlp.stanford.edu/projects/glove/), so that you don't have to train them yourself. (Though [you can train them yourself if you want to](https://radimrehurek.com/gensim/models/word2vec.html).)\n","\n","### Sentence vectors\n","\n","Importantly, two words with similar meanings will also have similar vectors (meaning, more or less, that all of the numbers in the vectors are similar in value). So you can tell if two words are synonymous by checking the similarity between their vectors.\n","\n","But what about the meaning of *entire sentences*? This is a little bit more difficult, and there are a number of different and sophisticated solutions (including Google's [Universal Sentence Encoder](https://www.tensorflow.org/hub/modules/google/universal-sentence-encoder/2) and [doc2vec](https://radimrehurek.com/gensim/models/doc2vec.html)). It turns out, though, that you can get a pretty good vector for a sentence simply by *averaging together the vectors for the words in the sentence*. We'll call such vectors *sentence vectors* or *summary vectors*.\n","\n","Intuitively, this makes sense: finding the average is a time-tested method in statistics of characterizing a data set. It's apparently no different with word vectors. This method has the additional benefits of being fast and easy to explain.\n","\n","## Writing the code\n","\n","With your understanding of these concepts, we can actually start writing some code. For our semantic similarity chatbot, we need:\n","\n","* Pre-trained word vectors\n","* A corpus of conversations\n","* Some code to parse conversations into turns and map each turn to its response\n","* Some code that can average the word vectors in some text to produce a sentence vector\n","* A database that will allow us to store sentence vectors and look them up by similarity\n","* Some code to take an incoming conversational turn, turn it into a sentence vector, and then look up the most similar vector in the database\n","\n","Let's take these one-by-one."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"1gQ6PaStQ171","colab_type":"text"},"source":["### Pre-trained word vectors\n","\n","We're going to use [spaCy](https://spacy.io), a wonderful Python library for natural language processing, both to tokenize text (i.e., turn text into a list of words) and for its database of word vectors.
